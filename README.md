DM Helper
========

This Android app is meant to be a rule-independent DM/GM helper. The plan is to keep it as generic as possible, while making it useful to as many tabletop RPG DM's as possible. I'm currently playing 4th edition D&D and will be migrating to D&D Next. I've played much 3rd and 3.5. As far as DMing goes, I feel like I have a handle on what's necessary and what would be nice to keep track of. For those familiar, I'm essentially trying to make Masterplan in an app, except, not stuck to D&D 4e.

My biggest goal is to help DM's get out from behind the DM screen. I'll be all but getting rid of my screen soon. With this app I'll be able to track combat and basic story elements. I can move around the table to adjust creatures on my mat. I can simply use player dice for rolls to make the experience more transparent. It's also just lame being tethered to my books.

To keep it rule intependent, I'm only storing basic forms of Player/Creature stats. Players will be the most basic, mostly just a name to put in the initative order since they'll have their character sheets. Creatures have basic hp and initative mod for now. You have the option to snap a picture using the device's camera that has all of the creature stats, however. This will allow you to quickly access information on the fly without having to enter in all the data.

This is a project for my own usage for now. Anyone is more than welcome to clone and use the app, or fork and help make it better, but I'm not planning a releas for awhile (maybe a beta once I have the core features). A collaboration of DM's will give a great view on what will and what won't be helpful.

If there are any major bugs, feel free to track them. They may or may not get fixed if they don't interfere with the usage at my gaming table.

I'm hoping to turn this in to a professional release eventually, but for now, with the time that I have, it will be a hobby project.

I'm keeping it consistent with common coding/naming practices. It's going to stay close to the Android UI guidelines (something fancier might happen in the future). It's going to stay well documented and well laid out so that anyone willing to contribute won't have to fight through terrible code to make an improvement.

Pull requests are more than welcome.

Here's a laundry list of feature hopefulls and their completion. (This will evolve over time, I'm sure)

Storing:<br>
~~Players~~<br>
~~Encounters~~<br>
~~Creatures~~<br>

Combat View (~~auto-rolling initative, tracking HP~~/effects, ~~progressing turn through the initative order~~, notifying of effect expiry)<br>
Campaign notes<br>
Story arc notes

And more to come as I come up with ideas...




Future
========

As time goes by and the app gets more and more fleshed out and useful. I would like to create a sort of online connection. It's going to suck having to type your campaign/story notes on a phone/tablet, it will also be a bummer having to make sure you have the same info if you use your tablet instead of your phone one day.

This is why I'll be creating an online sync option. With a web-based form for entering information with a proper keyboard. This will allow you to sync across laptop, phone and tablet. Also you can share some of your information with your friends. Have 100 creatures built up and switching DM's? Pass your friend all of your creature information and save him some time. Have 2 DMs creating an epic campaign and story arc? Collaborate on the same campaign without having to worry about making sure you added their new entries and they added yours.

So far, these are pipe dreams. We'll see how long it takes before we're ready for that.
